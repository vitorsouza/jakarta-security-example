# jakarta-security-example

A simple Jakarta Security example to understand how it works and test application servers

At this point the project only includes a simple example taken from the [Soteria](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/soteria) repository, more specifically [this one](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/soteria/tree/master/test/app-mem-customform).

The example has been tested to work on [Payara Server 5.2021.9 Community Edition (Web Profile)](https://www.payara.fish/downloads/payara-platform-community-edition/). I'm trying to make it work in [WildFly Preview 25.0.1](https://www.wildfly.org/downloads/), but I get an `IOException: ELY01177: Authorization failed`, not sure why yet...
